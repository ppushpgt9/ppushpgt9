- ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Pushp, and this is my portfolio

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Power BI and SQL. I have management experience and am also interested in the world of data analysis.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my professional journey as a radio jockey, followed by content creation, digital marketing, UX research and now I'm finally settled as a Business analyst.
  Hoping to move towards my goal of becoming a Project manager. I love organizing stuff, and currently, I'm exploiting my OCD to organize, and clean data, and present it insightfully.


-This repository was created to showcase my analytical and technical skills (Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, PowerPoint, and others).
